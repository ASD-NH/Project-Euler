# Project-Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a site where you can complete algorithm problems in any programming language and check your answers against the correct ones. This can be a great way to learn a new programming language, since the problems start at very low difficulty, or hone your skills with the more advanced problems. If you'd like to submit a solution, ask an admin to add you to the repository as a contributer. See the [Submission Guidelines](https://github.com/ASD-NH/Submission-Guidelines) for more information.

To keep things orderly, please follow this file naming convention when submitting files: `problem#-solution#`. The first person to submit a solution to a problem will have a solution number of 1, the second person will have 2, and so on.

For example, if you're submitting the third solution to the problem "Multiples of 3 and 5" (problem #1) in Python, the filename would be `problem1-solution3.py`. See the repository for more examples. Also remember to put your name in a comment at the top of your solution! Thanks so much! We'd love to see how ASD programs!
