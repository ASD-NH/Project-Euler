# Project-Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a site where you can complete algorithm problems in any programming language and submit the numerical answers. If you enjoy programming, this can be a great way to hone your skills. If you'd like to submit a solution, ask an admin to add you to the repository as a contributer. See the submission guidelines for more information.

To keep things orderly, please follow this file naming convention when submitting files:

- A number should be first, followed by a hyphen. The number represents the number solution it is. For example, the first solution submitted would have a 1, the second a 2, and so on.
- Next should be the name of the problem on Project Euler, all in lowercase. Replace spaces with hyphens.

Also remember to put your name and the problem number in a comment at the top of your solution! Thanks so much! We'd love to see how ASD programs!
